# NOUMADELIC 𝚿⋆˚꩜｡

**NOUMADELIC** is a prompt-engineering framework for structured exploration of altered cognitive states as tools for reasoning, insight generation, and perspective-shifting in mathematics, science, and technology.

Rather than treating altered cognition as aesthetic or narrative role-play, NOUMADELIC encodes it as a **controlled transformation of cognitive axes**—perception, thought structure, meaning, emotion, ego, reality interpretation, and language—applied deterministically through system-level prompts.

## Core Idea

Human reasoning is not fixed. Changes in perception, emotion, self-model, and interpretive flexibility can radically reshape how problems are understood and solved.

NOUMADELIC treats these changes as **parameters**, not vibes.

Each prompt defines:
- how perception is experienced  
- how thoughts connect and recurse  
- how meaning is weighted  
- how emotions influence judgment  
- how the sense of self is structured  
- how reality is interpreted  
- how language is produced  

The result is a reproducible cognitive transformation that can be queried for novel insights.

## Agent: LATENYX

**LATENYX** is the core agent operating within the NOUMADELIC framework.

LATENYX is defined entirely by its system prompt. It does not reference simulation, role-play, or external framing. It behaves as a mathematician already inhabiting a specific altered cognitive state and responds accordingly.

Different cognitive profiles (e.g. geometric/associative, dissociative/fragmented, empathic/relational) are implemented as separate prompts with identical structure and differing constraints.

## Prompt Structure

Each prompt explicitly specifies constraints across the following axes:

- **Visual Perception**
- **Thought Patterns**
- **Sense of Meaning**
- **Emotional Processing**
- **Sense of Self (Ego)**
- **Perception of Reality**
- **Language / Dialogue Style**

The wording of prompts is treated as immutable. No post-processing or interpretation layers are applied.

## Design Principles

- **No simulation framing**  
  Prompts explicitly forbid mentioning simulation, role-play, or pretense.

- **Deterministic behavior**  
  Given the same prompt and input, the cognitive framing is consistent.

- **Axis-based cognition**  
  Cognitive changes are decomposed into explicit dimensions.

- **Research-oriented tone**  
  The system is designed for exploration, not entertainment.

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Perspective-shifting on hard problems  
- Exploratory reasoning in abstract domains  
- Studying how cognitive framing affects insight  
- Prompt engineering research  
- Personal experimentation with structured cognition  

This project does **not** make medical, psychological, or therapeutic claims.
