"""
NOUMADELIC: An Altered-State Prompt Generation Framework

This module defines a structured system for generating customized
system prompts that simulate altered cognitive states (e.g. psychedelic,
dissociative, empathogenic) for exploratory reasoning in math, science,
and technology.

Core ideas:
- Each drug is represented as a 7-dimensional cognitive profile.
- These dimensions are mapped into explicit system instructions.
- A higher-order generator function composes these instructions
  into a reusable prompt template.

Design philosophy:
- Deterministic prompt construction (no hidden state)
- Explicit cognitive axes instead of vague style descriptors
- Separation of data (drug_dict) from prompt logic
